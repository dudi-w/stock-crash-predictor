# 📉 Stock Crash Predictor

This project aims to build a predictive model that can **detect early warning signs of stock market crashes** before they occur. By identifying common patterns and anomalies in historical stock data, the system attempts to provide timely alerts that precede financial downturns.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Detect anomalies across historical stock market data.
- Extract and analyze pre-crash time segments.
- Identify shared indicators or behavioral patterns preceding crashes.
- Validate predictions using test data for accuracy and reliability.
